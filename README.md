A dropbox clone. 

I wanted to try out dropbox's navigation architecture. Late into the project I didn't realise it could not open files. So I just stuck with what I had learnt along the way.

Things I tried with this project:
- Unit testing everything
- UI testing everything
- Swift's new API for Core Data
- Duplicating dropbox's iOS app navigation architecture
